        Do you wish you or your team knew more about how to make your Ruby on Rails application faster? Performance work can be intimidating at first: it might feel like it's over your head, too boring, or too esoteric. I disagree. My one-day workshops teach the fundamental skills of making Rails web applications fast, and do it in a way that's accessible and memorable.
      </p>

      <h3>Make Your App Faster than "Fast Enough"</h3>

      <p>
        Ruby web applications <b>don't have to be slow</b>, and you don't have to do backflips or refactor your entire application into service objects and microservices to do it. Four of the largest Rails applications in the world are <i>all</i> monolithic Rails applications and they <i>all</i> have response times of less than 100 milliseconds on average - Github, Shopify, Basecamp and Cookpad. None of them use a lot of Javascript or single-page-app frameworks like Vue, React, or Angular (3 out of 4 use Turbolinks!). Frequently, squeezing more performance out of your application ends up being a simple one-line change. Performance optimization is about measurement and experience more than execution, which is why <b>learning the fundamental performance skills of benchmarking, profiling, and measurement</b> can save you and your team <i>weeks</i> of banging your head against the wall and blind, premature optimization. We'll also talk about provisioning and cost savings, including how to use multi-threading and auto-scaling to your advantage. <b>You'll easily pay for your attendance just by what I'll teach you about reducing your server costs!</b>
      </p>

      <h3>A 1-Day, One-On-One Intensive</h3>

      <p>
        My workshops are small, intimate intensives intended to give you a solid base of skill in performance measurement (benchmarking, profiling) and for us to work together on problems specific to the applications you work on day-to-day. <b>Class sizes are 20 students or less</b> so I can have plenty of interaction with every student.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will learn:
        <ul>
          <li>How to find out exactly what parts of your application are slow</li>
          <li>What performance problems in Rails applications are hard to fix and which are easy</li>
          <li>Why premature optimization isn't just bad, it's a waste of time</li>
          <li>How to build a performance culture in your organization</li>
          <li>How Ruby's memory management works and what problems it can cause</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>And <a href="https://gist.github.com/nateberkopec/3639b2c07fc10883bb8ee6116517e7e4">here</a> is a complete syllabus.

      <p>
        My workshops, just like my courses, <b>are covered by a 100% money-back guarantee</b>. If you are not satisfied for any reason, I will refund your entire purchase. I anticipate that all workshop attendees should be able to save their company at least $1,000/year using the techniques taught at this workshop, with much <i>much</i> more savings possible, depending on the amount of traffic your Rails app serves.

      <h3>Testimonials</h3>
      <p>
        "I really enjoyed that we learned on our own projects. It was less 'theoretical' and more hands on so I don't have to try to 'translate' in a messy, real dev environment vs. a sterile setup." - Rachel Sison
      </p>

      <p>
        "After attending the workshop, our company improved response times, reduced queue times, and cut costs." - Ken Mayer
      </p>

      <p>
        "I have a bunch of pull requests that came out of the workshop. I have more tools in my toolset that I could use for future consulting projects." - Ernesto Tagwerker, Ombu Labs
      </p>

      <p>
        "After two days of training from Nate and a concerted effort from a few engineers, we had performance improvements of 10-50% on key flows.” - Rory O’Connell, Grand Rounds
      </p>
